# Wind Business Ecosystem Ontology (WBEO)

Wind Business Ecosystem Ontology (WBEO) is an ontology that is an application ontology that aims to capture the stakeholders and their relationships within the wind energy domain.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Planned Ontology Architecture showing the hierarchical integration of WBEO (Wind Business Ecosystem Ontology). The WBEO is positioned as a domain-specific ontology that inherits from the more general Business Ecosystem Ontology (BEO), which in turn extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2.0 at the upper ontology level. This architecture allows for parallel domain ontologies (like Textile BEO) to be developed using the same foundational structure, enabling interoperability and extensibility across business domains while maintaining domain-specific knowledge representation for the wind energy sector.</figcaption>
